# Plant Disease Identification and Classification

This project is a machine learning application for identifying and classifying plant diseases from images. It is now available for download on Android and iOS.

## Features
- Identify and classify 23 types of plant diseases from leaf images
- Deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- User-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing images
- Available on Android and iOS

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/triobaba/plant_disease.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies (see requirements.txt or environment.yml)
3. Run the application or use the mobile app

## Dataset
The model is trained on a curated dataset of healthy and diseased plant images, labeled by disease type. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets for robust model evaluation.

## Model
- Architecture: CNN (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch)
- Trained to classify 23 plant disease classes
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
