Plant Disease Identification and Classification
This project aims to develop a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the identification and classification of plant diseases. The model is designed to classify 23 types of diseases across different crops, including tomatoes, pepper, maize, potatoes, and apples.

**Dataset**


The dataset used for this project consists of a combined collection of images of healthy plants and plants affected by various diseases. The dataset is organized into a single folder with subfolders for each crop, containing images of both healthy plants and plants with diseases. The images are labeled accordingly, with each image belonging to one of the 23 disease classes.

The combined dataset is carefully curated, ensuring high-quality images and accurate labeling. It is collected from various reliable sources, including research institutions, agricultural organizations, and open datasets, to provide a diverse and comprehensive set of plant disease images.

**Model Architecture**


The CNN model used for disease identification and classification is built using the TensorFlow framework. The model architecture follows a standard design, consisting of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

The exact architecture and hyperparameters of the model may vary depending on the specific implementation. Extensive experimentation and optimization are conducted to determine the most suitable architecture that achieves high accuracy in disease identification and classification.

**Training**


The training process involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: The combined dataset is preprocessed to prepare it for training. This includes resizing the images to a uniform size, normalizing pixel values, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming. Data augmentation helps increase the robustness and generalization ability of the model.

Splitting the Dataset: The combined dataset is split into training, validation, and testing subsets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used for hyperparameter tuning and monitoring the model's performance, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model.

Model Training: The preprocessed dataset is used to train the CNN model. The model is trained using techniques like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam optimizer, with an appropriate learning rate and batch size. The training process involves iteratively feeding batches of images to the model, calculating the loss, and updating the model's parameters to minimize the loss.

Model Evaluation: After training, the model's performance is evaluated using the testing set. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are computed to assess the model's ability to correctly identify and classify plant diseases.
